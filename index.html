								<p>TempoTimer App Privacy Policy
									Introduction
									Welcome to the TempoTimer app! This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our app. By using TempoTimer, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
									
									Some of the data we collect is considered “personally identifiable information,” “personal information” or “personal data” under applicable law (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data”). Generally, Personal Data is information that can be reasonably connected to an identified or identifiable individual. It does not include de-identified or anonymized data. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you how we collect, use and share Personal Data and how we attempt to safeguard the Personal Data we collect and process. We are committed to securing the Personal Data that we collect concerning you (“you”) and complying with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post an amended version of the Privacy Policy. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically. 
									1. Legal Reasons we We Collect Information 
									OUR LEGAL REASONS FOR COLLECTING AND USING DATA
									
									We rely on the following legal grounds for the collection, processing, and use of personal data: 
									● the collection, processing and use is necessary to provide the Sites and Services as requested by you; 
									● your consent; 
									● the collection, processing and use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject; 
									● the collection, processing and use is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except (for residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)) where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of you which require protection of Personal Data; such legitimate interests are the fulfillment of the processing purposes set out above. In some circumstances, the provision of your personal data is voluntary, but in many cases it is necessary in order to access the Sites and/or receive Services your request. 
									2. Collection of Information
									WHY WE COLLECT DATA AND HOW WE COLLECT IT 
									
									We collect, process and use Personal Data to allow us to provide our Sites and Services to you. For example, we use the Personal Data we collect to: 
									
									● Troubleshoot and provide you with support; 
									 ● Personalize, enhance, an/or tailor your experience on our Sites and using our Services; 
									● Develop new features, products and services; 
									● Integrate with third-party applications; 
									● Analyze and improve our Sites and Services; 
									● Tailor our content, advertisements and offers; ●
									 Measure the performance of our Sites and Services; 
									● Provide information about data privacy and security; 
									● Assist with ensuring the security and integrity of the Sites and Services; 
									 ● Efficiently maintain our business; 
									● Comply with applicable law; and 
									● Defend our legal rights and the rights of others. 
									
									We obtain Personal Data directly from you, through cookies and other technologies, through your devices, and from third parties as described in this Policy and any other privacy notices we may provide to you when you interact with us. 
									3. Use of Personal Information
									PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY GENERALLY 
									
									a. Industry-Standard Protection. We utilize industry-standard security measures to safeguard the information we collect, maintain and use. These measures include technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction. However, we do not and cannot guarantee the performance or adequacy of such security measures. 
									
									b. Limitation on Access. Access to any Personal Data we collect and store is generally restricted to our employees and/or contractors who require it to perform a job or other contracted function. We require vendors and contractors we work with to use reasonable, industry standard protocols to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Data. 
									
									c. Processing of Data By App Store Providers. We make our mobile application available through various application stores. We assume no responsibility for the collection or processing of data by Google, Apple or any other app store provider at the time of downloading the App or creating an account with such app store providers. Please refer to the data privacy statements of these providers. There is no exchange of data between us and the app store providers. 
									4. Google Analytics and AdMob Compliance
									Google Analytics cookies and identifiers
									Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie. Learn more
									
									In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser add-on that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.
									
									Where a site or app uses Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs, Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier — a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.
									
									Where sites or apps have implemented Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like Google Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie using the Ads Settings. Learn more 
									
									 Google Analytics under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
									
									Google operates as a data processor for Google Analytics. This is reflected in our Ads Data Processing Terms, which are available to all Google Analytics customers with direct contracts with Google. Learn more
									
									Google Analytics is a data processor under GDPR because Google Analytics collects and processes data on behalf of our clients, pursuant to their instructions. Our customers are data controllers who retain full rights over the collection, access, retention, and deletion of their data at any time. Google’s use of data is controlled by the terms of its contract with Google Analytics customers and any settings enabled by customers through the user interface of our product. 
									 
									Google Analytics under Data Privacy Laws in the United States
									
									In order to help Google Analytics customers prepare for laws that establish various rights for applicable US-state residents, we have updated our Data Processing Terms to include a U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum. Subject to the full terms of this addendum, Google Analytics will act as a service provider to its customers (when data sharing with Google products and services is disabled) and as such, will only use data collected on behalf of the customer in Google Analytics to provide the Google Analytics services. Customers who have not accepted our Data Processing Terms can do so per these instructions. Customers who have already agreed to our Data Processing Terms will not need to take additional action to accept the CCPA service provider addendum. Customers should review the U.S. State Privacy Laws Service Provider and Processor Addendum, as well as Google Analytics’ use of data, to ensure it meets customer’s compliance needs.
									 
									 Google Analytics under the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) 
									
									 Google Analytics is a data processor under LGPD because Google Analytics collects and processes data on behalf of our clients, pursuant to their instructions. Our customers are data controllers who retain full rights over the collection, access, retention, and deletion of their data at any time. Google’s use of data is controlled by the terms of its contract with Google Analytics customers and any settings enabled by customers through the user interface of our product. 
									5. AdMob by Google
									AdMob is integrated into TempoTimer for ad serving. We adhere to AdMob’s requirements, including the need for a privacy policy that clearly discloses any data collection, sharing, and usage resulting from your use of Google products. Additionally, please note that Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is served to generate interests and demographics. Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the Privacy Sandbox initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on Topics or Protected Audience data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using Attribution Reporting data stored on their browser or mobile device. More information on the Privacy Sandbox. 
									
									6. COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
									
									In compliance with applicable law and our company practices, we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 16 years of age. We do not sell the Personal Data of children under 16 years old. 
									
									7. SOURCES AND TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT 
									
									a. Information We Collect Via Tracking Technology. We use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “cookies”) to collect information as you navigate the Sites. Cookies are small files of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer hard drive, mobile or other devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets). Information that may be collected via cookies include: 
									● Unique personal identifiers (device identifiers, IP address, cookies, beacons, pixel tags, mobile ad identifiers and other forms or persistent or probabilistic identifiers that can be used to identify a particular consumer or device); 
									● Internet or other electronic network activity information (browsing history; search history; and information regarding your interaction with website, application or advertisement); 
									● Device information, such as your browser type and version, language, time zone, operating system and version, location. Types of cookies we use: 
									● Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Strictly Necessary Cookies may not be disabled. 
									● Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the website works. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. 
									● Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, these cookies can be used to remember the volume level you prefer to use when watching videos on our website. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. 
									● Targeting Cookies: These cookies are small encrypted files that track user’s actions and are used to identify users between different websites. Targeting cookies collect user information and use it to build profiles of user interests and then show personalized ads for that user. These cookies may be referred to as marketing and advertisement cookies. We use Cookies to: (a) estimate audience size and usage patterns; (b) understand and save your preferences for future visits, allowing us to customize the Sites and Services to your individual needs; (c) advertise new content, events and services that relate to your interests; (d) keep track of advertisements and search engine results; (e) compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions to resolve issues and offer better Site experiences and tools in the future; and (f) recognize when you return to the Site(s). We set some Cookies ourselves and others are set by service providers. We use Cookies set by service providers to provide us with useful information to help us improve our Sites and Services, to conduct advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising. You can control the use of cookies at the browser level by setting your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Sites and Services. In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information on this, please visit the websites: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com or http://globalprivacycontrol.org. 
									
									b. Non-Identifiable Information. We collect and use non-personally identifiable user information (“Non-PII”) for several purposes, including (without limitation): (i) to calculate necessary royalty payments to third party content providers, which are often based on the number of times a work is opened or accessed by our users; (ii) to prepare reports and other materials that we may share with others in an anonymous format; and (iii) for analytics purposes. In some instances, we use third-party vendors to collect, monitor and/or maintain Non-PII. For example, we utilize Google SSO and Google Analytics. Information logged includes common request data. Google Analytics is utilized to analyze application, feature and content usage. 
									
									8. HOW GOOGLE USES INFORMATION FROM TEMPOTIMER ADMOB SERVICES
									
									Many apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free. When they integrate, these sites and apps share information with Google. For example, when you visit an app that uses advertising services like AdSense, including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or Admob or embeds video content from YouTube, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the app and your IP address. Google may also set cookies on your browser or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google, such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.
									
									Google uses the information shared by sites and apps to deliver these services, maintain and improve them, develop new services, measure the effectiveness of advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalize content and ads you see on Google and on our partners’ sites and apps. See Googles Privacy Policy to learn more about how we process data for each of these purposes and our Advertising page for more about Google ads, how your information is used in the context of advertising, and how long Google stores this information.
									
									Googles Privacy Policy explains the legal grounds Google relies upon to process your information — for example, google may process your information with your consent or to pursue legitimate interests such as providing, maintaining and improving our services to meet the needs of our users.
									9. Ad personalization
									If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.
									
									If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
									
									When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
									
									You can see and control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.
									10. How you can control the information collected by Google
									Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your device when you visit or interact with TempoTimer that use Google services:
									
									Ad Settings helps you control ads you see on Google services (such as Google Search or YouTube), or on non-Google websites and apps that use Google ad services. You can also learn how ads are personalized, opt out of ad personalization, and block specific advertisers.
									If you are signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your Account settings, My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s created when you use Google services, including the information we collect from the sites and apps you have visited. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.
									Many websites and apps use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on. Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy.
									Incognito mode in Chrome allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser or Account history (unless you choose to sign in). Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about cookies. Using Incognito mode in Chrome or other private browsing modes does not prevent the collection of data when you visit websites that use Google services, and Google may still collect data when you visit websites using these browsers.
									Many browsers, including Chrome, allow you to block third-party cookies. You can also clear any existing cookies from within your browser. Learn more about managing cookies in Chrome. 
									11. UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISMS 
									The Sites recognize the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. If you are using a browser setting or plug-in that sends and opt-out preference signal to the Site you visit, we will treat that as a valid request to opt out. To download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs. If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. 
									
									Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Site does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals. 
									12. NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
									The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to individuals located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR allows us to collect and use personal information from individuals within the EEA only for one or more of the following reasons: 1. To fulfill a contract we have with you; 2. When we have a legal duty; 3. When it is in our legitimate interest; or 4. When you provide consent. We do not operate in the EEA or specifically direct our business to consumers in the EEA. However, we recognize some of our website users, customers and prospective customers could be located within the EEA. If you reside in the EEA, you have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to the way we process your Personal Data, which are set forth below. You may contact us directly to exercise any of these rights, and we will verify your request and, if appropriate, respond to any request received from you within one month from the date of the request. In exceptional circumstances we may need to extend this timescale, but we will always tell you in advance if we do, and our reasons why. Right 1 A right to access personal data held by us about you, as well as information about how we are using your data. Right 2 A right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data held by us about you. Right 3 A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about you, and where the personal data has been made public, for other controllers processing the personal data to also erase links to, or copy or replication of, such personal data. This right will only apply where (for example): we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for; or where you withdraw your consent if we are using your personal data based on your consent; or where you object to the way we process your data (in line with Right 6 below). Right 4 A right to restrict our processing of personal data held by us about you. This right will only apply where (for example): you dispute the accuracy of the personal data held by us; or where you would have the right to require us to erase the personal data but would prefer that our processing is restricted instead; or where we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for, but you require the data for the purposes of dealing with legal claims. Right 5 A right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data to another organization, at your request. Right 6 A right to object to our processing of personal data held by us about you (including for the purposes of sending marketing materials to you). Right 7 A right to withdraw your consent, where we are relying on it to use your personal data (for example, to provide you with marketing information about our services or products). If you have any concerns regarding our processing of your personal data, or are not satisfied with our handling of any request by you in relation to your rights, please get in touch with our team through the contact information provided in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. You may also reach out to your applicable Data Protection Authority (“DPA”) for more information. There is a DPA located in each EU Member State. 
									
									13. SECURITY 
									
									We take industry standard security measures to protect your information. We also have put into place appropriate agreements and/or procedures with our service providers to ensure that your Personal Data is treated consistent with applicable data privacy and security laws. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your data. 
									
									14. DATA RETENTION
									
									TempoTimer does not directly store data. Only data collected by Google AdMob would be retained. View their Privacy Policy for more information.
									
									15. ACCESSIBILITY 
									
									We value all of our users, and it is our goal to provide an excellent experience for all our users, including our users with disabilities. You understand and accept, however, that some of the features of the Site and Services may not be fully accessible because they are provided by third-parties or have errors. If you wish to access this Privacy Policy in an alternate format, or would like to report an issue you are experiencing on our Sites or Services, please contact us at the information below. You expressly agree to attempt to resolve any and all issues with accessibility directly with us and in good faith prior to instituting any legal action against us.
									 
									16. STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES 
									
									Depending on the state in which you reside, you may have certain privacy rights regarding your personal data. If you are a California resident, please see our “Notice to California Residents” section below. For other state residents, your privacy rights may include (if applicable): 
									● The right to confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and to access such personal data; 
									● The right to obtain a copy of your personal data that we collected from and/or about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; 
									● The right to delete personal data that we collected from and/or about you, subject to certain exceptions;
									 ● The right to correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions; 
									● The right, if applicable, to opt out of the processing of your personal data for purposes of (1) targeted advertising; (2) the “sale” of your personal data (as that term is defined by applicable law); and (3) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you; 
									● If we are required by applicable law to obtain your consent to process sensitive personal data, the right to withdraw your consent; and 
									● The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights. 
									
									We do not sell personal data. However, depending on how applicable privacy laws define a “sale,” our use of cookies and tracking technologies may constitute a sale of personal data (i.e., information from cookies) to third-party advertisers and analytics companies. Our Sites also use cookies and other tracking technologies to display advertisements about our products to you on nonaffiliated websites, applications, and online services. This is “targeted advertising” under applicable privacy laws. We do not use personal data for profiling in furtherance of “decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects” concerning individuals. To exercise your rights, contacts us at the information below. If legally required, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the individual on whose behalf you are making such request. To do so, we will ask you to verify data points based on information we have in our records. If you are submitting a request on behalf of another individual, please use the same contact methods described above. If we refuse to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at the information below.
									 
									17. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS 
									
									This Privacy Notice to California Consumers (“CA Notice”) is for California residents and supplements the other sections of our Privacy Policy. This CA Notice explains how we collect, use and disclose your “Personal Information” (as that term is defined by California law) and how you may exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). This Notice is intended solely for, and is applicable only as to, California residents. If you are not a California resident, this does not apply to you.
